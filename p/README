Steps to compile the source code: 

1. Clone the project from git
2. Edit the AVPLAYER_PATH variable in jni/Android.mk
3. Edit the LOCAL_LDLIBS variable in jni/app/Android.mk
4. While compiling in windows, Change the directory convention from "/" to "\", if required
5. For compiling in windows, Use a shorter path name like "C:\p" or "D:\p". Longer path will cause problems in compilation as the command line length limitation will be reached during compilation.

NDK Compilation (r8 or similar)
3. Goto project directory (p directory)
4. Run compile.sh (calls the following in order: ndk-build clean, ndk-build -j2 V=1 and copies the libffmpeg.so file)

APK Compilation Steps
5. Import the project in Eclipse 3.6 or latest with ADT Plugin support
6. Start building the project and run it in Emulator or in Device
