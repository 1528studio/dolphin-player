Steps to compile the source code: 

1. Clone the project from git
2. Edit the AVPLAYER_PATH variable in jni/Android.mk
3. Edit the LOCAL_LDLIBS variable in jni/app/Android.mk
4. For compiling in windows, Use a shorter path name like "C:/p" or "D:/p". Longer path will cause problems in compilation as the command line length limitation will be reached during compilation. 
   (Windows Debugging: 
     a) Compile and run any ndk example/sample, before compiling this project, to test if ndk is working in windows
     b) Sometimes cygwin terminal behaves with not responding to (ndk-build clean or ndk-build) or with error 127. Restarting windows, solves the problem
   )

Note: This project is compiled and tested in Windows, Mac and Linux and works fine:

NDK Compilation (r8 or similar)
3. Goto project directory (p directory)
4. Run compile.sh (calls the following in order: ndk-build clean, ndk-build -j2 V=1 and copies the libffmpeg.so file) (Edit the ndk-build path in this script)

APK Compilation Steps
5. Import the project in Eclipse 3.6 or latest with ADT Plugin support
6. Start building the project and run it in Emulator or in Device
